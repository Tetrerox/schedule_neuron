# ScheduleNeuron
 
 This application was created by me and my partner for the Orbital project at my university. The orbital project is an independent software development project 
 where pairs of students get to develop any application of their choice under advisers. We decided to create a productivity mobile application called 
 ScheduleNeuron.
 
 Here is the tech stack that was used:
 
* Flutter (Dart as the programming language)
* Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service
* Firebase Auth for authentication
* Firebase Firestore for the database (NoSQL)
